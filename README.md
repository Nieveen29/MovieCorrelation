# 📽️ Movie Correlation Project

This project explores the relationships between different features of movies using Python and data visualization libraries. The goal is to identify which factors correlate most with a movie’s gross revenue.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze a movie dataset and uncover key correlations that impact box office performance.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Budget
- Gross revenue
- Runtime
- IMDb scores
- Company
- Year released

## 📈 Key Analyses

- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values, converted data types)
- Created scatter plots and heatmaps to identify correlations
- Used `.corr()` to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients
- Investigated how budget and score relate to gross earnings

## 🔍 Findings

- A strong positive correlation exists between **budget** and **gross revenue**
- **Company** and **release year** have weaker or inconsistent correlations with gross
- Visualization is critical for identifying trends and anomalies

## 📎 Conclusion

Understanding which movie attributes influence earnings can inform investment and production decisions in the film industry.
